# Supercollider !!!
A Library of all my various supercollider code and resources for easy reference!

# Scripts Broken Down

## synthdefs.scd
  Just a long list of a bunch of created synthdefs for me to pull from in other scripts, or when making a supercollider file by hand. This is already used in my python script that can generate a supercollider script or midi file.

## first-examples.scd
  Everything needs a starting point, no? With this I can have a file that I have no issues making long, a little unkempt, and packed with a little bit of everything I try to test out!
